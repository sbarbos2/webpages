<!--Here are the answers to question 3-->
    <p>My name is Steven Barbosa. I am a first-year engineering student. My current major is engineering first-year with mechanical engineering intent. I chose this major because
	I think mechanical engineering is not only versatile, but super interesting. </p>    
	
	<br/>
	
	<p>I think my dream job would be in some sort of mechanical engineering job. I'm not sure what job exactly, 
	but I like the idea of working in the automotive industry or working as a bridge engineer.</p>
